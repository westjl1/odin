        DIRECTIONS
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cream the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl using a hand or stand
            mixer until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each, then mix in the vanilla and peanut butter until fully
            combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, then slowly add the dry
            ingredients to the wet and mix on low until a thick, sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and chill it in the fridge for at least 3 hours, or up to 2 days if you get distracted and
            forget about it like I did once.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking
            mats.</li>
        <li>Roll balls of dough (about 1.5 tablespoons each), roll them in sugar if you like, and place them 2 inches
            apart on the baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Press a fork into the tops to create the classic criss-cross pattern, then bake for 12 to 13 minutes until
            the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then move them to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
