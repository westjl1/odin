    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>For a delicious, classic French toast recipe, you will need the following ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk (whole milk for a richer flavor, or any milk alternative like almond milk)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 slices of bread (preferably day-old or thick-cut)</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for frying</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, powdered sugar, or fresh fruit for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <p>Here is how to make your French toast:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the Egg Mixture: In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.
            Whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Dip the Bread: Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil. Dip one
            slice of bread into the egg mixture, making sure both sides are coated, but not soaked.</li>
        <li>Cook the French Toast: Place the dipped bread on the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until
            golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once both sides are golden brown, remove the French toast from the skillet and place it on a plate.
            Top with your favorite toppings—maple syrup, fresh berries, or a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
    </ol>
